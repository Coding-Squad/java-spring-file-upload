Upload images using Java Spring MVC

#Overview
In this simple application I am using Spring MVC and JPA (Hibernate) to persist User's information to the database including their profile photo/image. 

#Requirements
1. MySQL database needs to be installed
2. Internet connection to download the dependencies
3. Coding eyes to understand the code :)

#Instructions
1. Clone the project to your local machine
2. Import the project into Spring Tool Suite/Eclipse
3. Locate the Database folder and change the database name, username and password
4. Open the modisefileupload.java.config.UserController and modify the image path (for development purposes you will need to point the path to you local computer, I have commented out the actual rootDirect to be used in the Server).
5. Right click on the project and run on server
6. Enjoy!
